      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about programming and I am an intuitive learner. The current programming languages I know are C++, C# (CSharp), Python, Javascript, HTML, and LUA.
        I am developing fluency in python and HTML and I am fluent in LUA. I love investigating things to the fullest and 
        using logical thinking to solve hard problems.

      <h2>Where I've Programmed</h2>
      <p>
        I have programmed on the gaming platform ROBLOX in their LUAU interpretor and have modded GTAV.
        I currently use Visual Studio Community (Microsoft) and Visual Studio Code to code my projects.
        I have attempted to mod the vehicle physics game BeamNG.drive, however, their modding has
        a strict format and has a steep learning curve that I am not use to and will need to learn.
        I have programmed a little on IOS using Scriptable which uses JavaScript.

      <h2>My Education</h2>
      <p>
        I taught myself LUAU, Python, C#, and C++, after being introduced to JavaScript and HTML in 8th grade.
        I currently go to a school in Ohio which I won't disclose for privacy purposes.
        While some argue that AI isn't suited for large-scale coding projects, I partially agree. 
        I believe AI excels when used to analyze code snippets, suggest improvements, assist 
        with specific components, or recommend creative ideas. I've personally leveraged AI as a 
        learning tool, using it to deepen my understanding of computer programming and stay 
        engaged while also teaching myself. It's become an invaluable guide throughout my self-taught journey.

      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>C++ isn't my favorite language due to its heavy use of special characters, but I recognize its uses.</li>
        <li>I am currently going into Highschool and getting my Highschool Diploma.</li>
        <li>I like organizing things as I feel it allows objectives to be completed easily.</li>
        <li>I have little patience for people who intentionally choose not to follow directions.</li>
        <li>I like organizing ideas in a notepad and then work on them.</li>
